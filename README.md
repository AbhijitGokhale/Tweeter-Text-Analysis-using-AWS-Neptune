Graphs can represent the interrelationships of real-world entities in many ways, in terms of actions, ownership, parentage, purchase choices, personal connections, family ties, and so on.

## Why Graph?
* Graph databases are optimized to store and query the relationships between data items.*
* They store data items as vertices of the graph, and the relationships between them as edges. Each edge has a type and is directed from one vertex (the start) to another (the end). Relationships can be called predicates as well as edges, and vertices are also sometimes referred to as nodes. In so-called property graphs, both vertices and edges can have additional properties associated with them too.*

* The edges are shown as named arrows, and the vertices represent specific people and hobbies that they connect.
